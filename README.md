## _Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages Via HTTPS_

This specification provides guidance to the OpenC2 implementation
community when utilizing HTTPS for OpenC2 message transport.

### :twisted_rightwards_arrows: Repository Organization :twisted_rightwards_arrows:

![branches](images/repo-branches.png)

OpenC2 work product repositories are organized a bit differently
than typical open source software project repositories:

* The **Published** (default) branch represents the current,
  stable, approved version of the work product. If the product
  hasn't progressed past an [OASIS Committee Specification Draft
  (CSD)](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process-2017-05-26/#committeeDraft),
  this branch is essentially empty
* The **Working** branch is where all work-in-progress content is
  captured, and is the place to go for the [current working
  version](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-transf-mqtt/blob/working/transf-mqtt-v1.0.md)
  of this work product

More information about the TC's repository organizing conventions
and branching strategy can be found in our [Documentation
Norms](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openc2-tc-ops/blob/main/Documentation-Norms.md#433-configure-repository).

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This GitHub repository supports development of content and change tracking for the OpenC2 HTTPS Transfer Specification as new working draft level revisions are created and the associated CSDs mature. 

The repository is designed to support TC members' work on a
formal specification that describes the use of secure Hyptertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) as a transfer mechanism for OpenC2
messages. HTTPS  provides a widely-used point-to-point
messaging transport protocol.  This specification provides
guidance to the OpenC2 implementation community when utilizing
HTTPS  for OpenC2 message transport.

The Work Product title for the work is:
"Specification for Transfer of OpenC2 Messages via HTTPS, Version
1.1", edited by David Lemire (HII).
