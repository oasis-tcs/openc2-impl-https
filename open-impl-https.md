# 1 Introduction

_The content in this section is non-normative, except where it is marked normative._

OpenC2 is a suite of specifications that enables command and control of cyber defense systems and components. OpenC2 typically uses a request-response paradigm where a _Command_ is encoded by a _Producer_ (managing application) and transferred to a _Consumer_ (managed device or virtualized function) using a secure transfer protocol, and the Consumer can respond with status and any requested information.

This document specifies the use of Hypertext Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS) as a transfer
mechanism for OpenC2 Messages; this HTTP/TLS layering is
typically referred to as HTTPS [[RFC2818](#rfc2818)]. As
described in [[RFC3205](#rfc3205)], HTTP has become a common
"substrate" for information transfer for other application-level
protocols. The broad availability of HTTP makes it a useful
option for OpenC2 message transport in support of prototyping,
interoperability testing, and for operational use in environments
where appropriate security protections can be provided.

Similarly, TLS is a mature and widely-used protocol for securing
information transfers in TCP/IP network environments. This
specification provides guidance to the OpenC2 implementation
community when utilizing HTTPS for OpenC2 message transport. It
includes guidance for selection of TLS versions and options
suitable for use with OpenC2. In addition, a Testing conformance
target is defined to support interoperability testing without
security mechanisms. 

This OpenC2 over HTTPS transfer specification is suitable for operational environments where: 

* Connectivity between OpenC2 Producers and OpenC2 Consumers is: 
    * Highly available, with infrequent network outages
    * Of sufficient bandwidth that no appreciable message delays or dropped packets are experienced 
* In-band negotiation of a connection initiated by either Producer or Consumer is possible without requiring an out-of-band signaling network.
* The overhead of HTTPS is acceptable.

An additional application for this transfer specification is interoperability test environments.


## 1.1 Changes from Earlier Versions

Changes since v1.0, CS01:
* Defined a standard Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme and added a corresponding conformance requirement.
* Specified the use of the atomic OpenC2 message structure, updated content-type accordingly, and adjusted examples to match
* Testing and Operations conformance targets and requirements have been defined to support both secure (HTTPS) and non-secure (HTTP) message transfers with a single specification
* Added new section with requirements for message correlation
* Restructured to use the updated OASIS work products outline
* Other minor changes and corrections have been incorporated based on plug fest and interoperability testing experiences

## 1.2 Glossary

# 2 Operating Model
_This section is non-normative._

This section describes the operating model used when transferring
OpenC2 Commands and Responses using HTTPS. 

> NOTE: This specification provides for both HTTP and HTTPS
> message transfer. For convenience HTTPS is used as the general
> term for the transfer protocol throughout this specification.
> For non-secure operations using the Testing coformance target
> "HTTPS" should be read as equivalent to "HTTP".

Each endpoint of an OpenC2-over-HTTPS interaction has both an
OpenC2 role and an HTTP function. OpenC2 Consumers will be HTTP
listeners (i.e., servers) so that they can accept connections and
receive unsolicited Commands from OpenC2 Producers. OpenC2
Producers act as HTTP clients and transmit Commands to Consumers.

Figure 2 illustrates the Producer / Consumer interactions. A
Producer that needs to send OpenC2 Commands initiates a TCP
connection to the Consumer. Once the TCP connection is created, a
TLS session is initiated to authenticate the endpoints and
provide connection confidentiality. The Producer can then issue
OpenC2 Commands by sending HTTP requests using the POST method
through the TLS connection, with Consumer OpenC2 Responses
returned in the HTTP response.

# 3 Protocol Mappings
The section defines the requirements for using HTTP and TLS with OpenC2, including general requirements and protocol mappings for the operating configuration described in Section 2.

## 3.1 	Layering Overview
When using HTTPS for OpenC2 Message transfer, the layering model is:

| Layer | Description |
|:---|:---|
| OpenC2 Content | The _OpenC2 Language Specification_ defines the overall OpenC2 language, and the _Actuator Profile(s)_ implemented by any particular endpoint scopes the OpenC2 actions, targets, arguments, and specifiers that apply when commanding that type of Actuator.  |
| Serialization | Serialization converts internal representations of OpenC2 content into a form that can be transmitted and received. The OpenC2 default serialization is JSON. |
| Message | The message layer provides a content- and transport-independent mechanism for conveying requests and responses.  A Message consists of serialized content plus a set of metadata items such as content type and version, sender, timestamp, and correlation id.  This layer maps the transport-independent definition of each message element to its transport-specific on-the-wire representation.|
| HTTP | The HTTP layer is responsible for conveying request and response Messages, as described in this specification. |
| TLS | The TLS layer is responsible for authentication of connection endpoints and confidentiality and integrity of transferred Messages.  |
| Lower Layer Transport | The lower protocol layers are responsible for end-to-end delivery of Messages. TCP/IP is the most common suite of lower layer protocols used with HTTPS. |

## 3.2 General Requirements
This section defines general requirements for using HTTPS to
transfer OpenC2 messages, including HTTP method, message
serialization, and TLS requirements.

### 3.2.1 HTTP Usage
OpenC2 Consumers MUST be HTTP listeners to implement the
operating model described in [Section 2](#2-operating-model).
OpenC2 Consumers acting as HTTP listeners SHOULD listen on:

* port 80, the registered port for HTTP, when used for testing.
* port 443, the registered port for HTTPS, when used for operations.

OpenC2 endpoints MUST implement all HTTP functionality required by this specification in accordance with HTTP/1.1 ([[RFC7230](#rfc7230)], _et. al._). As described in Table 3-1, the only HTTP request method utilized is POST. 


| Utilized?  | HTTP Methods |
|:---:|:---|
| Yes | POST |
| No | GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE | 

**Table 3-1: HTTP Method Use**

Each HTTP message body MUST contain only a single OpenC2 Command or Response message. This does not preclude a Producer and Consumer exchanging multiple OpenC2 Command and Response Messages over time during a single HTTPS session. Depending on the set-up, a server and client can have multiple connections, but a sequence of OpenC2 interactions can spread over multiple connections. In some cases the connection may drop, but the session remains open (in an idle state).

All HTTP request and response messages containing OpenC2 payloads SHOULD include the "Cache-control:" header with a value of "no-cache".

### 3.2.2 URI Scheme

When transferring OpenC2 Command messages over HTTPS, the Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) structure in Table 3-2 MUST be
employed:

| Scheme  | Address | Path |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `https://` | `[Consumer Address]` | `/.well-known/openc2` |

**Table 3-2: OpenC2 HTTPS URI Structure**

This path format conforms to the the IETF's "`/.well-known/`" path prefix for well-known locations, as defined in [[RFC8615](#rfc8615)]

OpenC2 Producers sending Command messages MUST POST those
messages to the URI defined in Table 3-2.  

OpenC2 Consumers acting as HTTP listeners MUST accept Command
messages POSTed to the URI defined in Table 3-2.

### 3.2.3 TLS Usage
HTTPS, the transmission of HTTP over TLS, is specified in Section 2 of [[RFC2818](#rfc2818)]. OpenC2 endpoints MUST accept TLS version 1.2 [[RFC5246](#rfc5246)] connections or higher for confidentiality, identification, and authentication when sending OpenC2 Messages over HTTPS, and SHOULD accept TLS Version 1.3 [[RFC8446](#rfc8446)] or higher connections.

OpenC2 endpoints MUST NOT support any version of TLS prior to v1.2 and MUST NOT support any version of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). 

The implementation and use of TLS SHOULD align with the best currently available security guidance, such as that provided in [[RFC7525](#rfc7525)]/BCP 195.

The TLS session MUST use non-NULL ciphersuites for authentication, integrity, and confidentiality. Sessions MAY be renegotiated within these constraints.

OpenC2 endpoints supporting TLS v1.2 MUST NOT use any of the deprecated ciphersuites identified in Appendix A of [[RFC7540](#rfc7540)]. 

OpenC2 endpoints supporting TLS 1.3 MUST NOT implement zero round trip time resumption (0-RTT).

### 3.2.4 Authentication

Each participant in an OpenC2 communication MUST authenticate the other participant.

## 3.3 OpenC2 Message Format

This section describes how OpenC2 messages are represented in HTTP requests.

### 3.3.1  Content Type and Serialization

While the OpenC2 language is agnostic of serialization, when transferring OpenC2 Messages over HTTP/TLS as described in this specification, the default JSON serialization described in [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0](#openc2-lang-v10)] MUST be supported.

When OpenC2 Messages are sent over HTTPS using the default JSON serialization the message MUST specify the content type `"application/openc2+json;version=1.0"`. 

### 3.3.2 OpenC2 Message Structure

OpenC2 messages transferred using HTTPS utilize the
`OpenC2-Message` structure defined in Section 3.2 of
[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0](#openc2-lang-v10).

 ``` 
Message = Record
  1 headers       Headers optional
  2 body          Body
  3 signature     String optional

Headers = Map{1..*}
  1 request_id    String optional
  2 created       ls:Date-Time optional
  3 from          String optional
  4 to            String [0..*]

Body = Choice
  1 openc2        OpenC2-Content

OpenC2-Content = Choice
  1 request       OpenC2-Command
  2 response      OpenC2-Response
  3 notification  OpenC2-Event  
 ```

Since HTTPS provides a point-to-point connection between an
OpenC2 Producer and Consumer, the message `from` and `to` fields
are not needed for addressing. However, OpenC2 Producers and
Consumers MAY populate the message headers `from` and `to`
fields.

### 3.3.3 Message Identification

OpenC2 Producers and Consumers need the ability to identify
requests and corresponding responses in order to correlate
activity. In addition, it is common for network monitoring tools
to similarly track HTTP requests and responses. The OpenC2
message format includes a header field, `request_id` that is the
OpenC2 mechanism for message correlation. The extension header
`X-Request-ID` is commonly used in HTTP traffic for the same
purpose. This specification supports the use of these mechanisms
in parallel, with the following requirements:

* OpenC2 Producers MUST generate a unique identifying value for
  OpenC2 Command (i.e., request) messages, and SHOULD use an
  [[RFC4122](#rfc4122)] UUID_v4 identifier for that purpose.

* OpenC2 Producers MUST populate either the HTTP `X-Request-ID`
  header or the OpenC2 message header `request_id` field with the
  Command message's unique identifying value, and SHOULD populate
  both locations.

* OpenC2 Consumers MUST return the Command message's unique
  identifying value in corresponding Response messages.

* When responding to a Command message that did not contain an
  OpenC2 `request_id`, the OpenC2 Consumer MUST populate the
  Response message `request_id` header field with the unique
  identifying value from the Command message's `X-Request-ID`
  header.

## 3.4 OpenC2 Consumer as HTTP/TLS Server
This section defines HTTP requirements that apply to the OpenC2 Consumer operating as the HTTP server.

As the OpenC2 Consumer is the HTTP server, the Producer initiates a 
connection to a specific Consumer and directly transmits OpenC2 Messages containing Commands; 
the HTTP POST method is used, with the OpenC2 Command body contained in the POST body.

The following HTTP request headers MUST be populated when transferring OpenC2 Commands:

* Host:  host name of HTTP server:listening port number (if other than port 80 [testing] / 443 [operations])
* Content-type:  `application/openc2+json;version=1.0` (when using the default JSON serialization)
* Accept: `application/openc2+json;version=1.0` (when using the default JSON serialization)


The following HTTP response headers MUST be populated when transferring OpenC2 Responses:

* Content-type: `application/openc2+json;version=1.0` (when using the default JSON serialization)


The following HTTP request and response headers SHOULD be populated when transferring OpenC2 Commands and Responses when the Consumer is the HTTP/TLS server:

* Date: date-time in the preferred IMF-fixdate format as defined
  by Section 7.1.1.1 of [RFC 7231](#rfc7231); the conditions for
  populating the `Date:` header specified in Section 7.1.1.2 of
  RFC 7231 SHALL be followed 


Example messages can be found in Appendix E, section E.1.

# 4 Conformance

This specification defines conformance targets and requirements for 

1) Testing:  HTTP without TLS, using port 80 
2) Operations:  HTTP with TLS, using port 443

## 4.1 Conformance Targets

The conformance targets for this specification are:

* **Testing**:  this conformance target applies to the transfer
  of OpenC2 messages over HTTP in environments where
  interoperability is a primary concern and security protections
  are optional. For example, the Testing conformance target is
  appropriate for prototyping and "plug fest" interoperability
  demonstration situations.

* **Operations**: this conformance target applies to the transfer
  of OpenC2 messages over HTTPS in environments where security or
  the demonstration of secure interoperability is a primary
  concern.

The Testing and Operations targets MUST NOT be concurrently
available; an OpenC2 Consumer MUST reject non-secure connections
when conforming to the Operations target.

## 4.2 Conformance Requirements

This section defines the conformance requirements for the two
conformance targets identified in [Section
4.1](#41-conformance-targets).

### 4.2.1 Testing Target Conformance Requirements

A conformant implementation of this transfer specification for
the **Testing** conformance target MUST:

1. Support JSON serialization as specified in 
   [Section 3.3.1](#331-serialization-and-content-types).
2. Transfer OpenC2 Messages using the content type defined in
   [Section 3.3.1](#331-serialization-and-content-types).
3. Listen for HTTP connections on port 80 as specified in
   [Section 3.2.1](#321-http-usage).
4. Use HTTP POST method as specified in Sections
   [3.2.1](#321-http-usage), and
   [3.4](#34-openc2-consumer-as-httptls-server), and no other
   HTTP methods.
5. Transfer OpenC2 command messages to the HTTP listener using
   the URI scheme specified in [Section 3.2.2](#322-uri-scheme).
6. Ensure HTTP request and response messages only contain a
   single OpenC2 message, as specified in [Section 3.2.1](#321-http-usage).
7. Employ HTTP methods to send and receive OpenC2 Messages as
   specified in [Section 3.4](#34-openc2-consumer-as-httptls-server).
8. Employ only the HTTP response codes specified in
   [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0](#openc2-lang-v10)], Section 3.3.2.1.
9. Utilize the OpenC2 message format specified in 
    [Section 3.3.2](#332-openc2-message-structure).
10. Support the handling of unique message identifiers as
    specified in [Section 3.3.3](#333-message-identification)

### 4.2.2 Operations Target Conformance Requirements

A conformant implementation of this transfer specification for
the **Operations** conformance target MUST:

1. Satisfy all of the requirements for the **Testing** conformance
   target as specified in 
   [Section 4.2.1](#421-testing-target-conformance-requirements).

# Appendix E. Examples
_This section is non-normative._

OpenC2 Messages consist of a set of "message elements" defined in
Section 3.2 of [[OpenC2-Lang-v1.0](#openc2-lang-v10)]. The
example messages below illustrate how this is handled in
practice.

A Request-URI ending in `/.well-known/openc2` is used in all example HTTP requests.

## E.1 HTTP Request / Response Examples: Consumer as HTTP Server
This section presents the HTTP message structures used when the OpenC2 Consumer acts as the HTTP listener.

### E.1.1 Producer HTTP POST with OpenC2 Command
Example message:

```
POST /.well-known/openc2 HTTP/1.1
Content-type: application/openc2+json;version=1.0
Date: Wed, 19 Dec 2018 22:15:00 GMT
X-Request-ID: d1ac0489-ed51-4345-9175-f3078f30afe5

{
  "headers": {
    "request_id": "d1ac0489-ed51-4345-9175-f3078f30afe5",
    "created": 1545257700000,
    "from": "oc2producer.company.net",
    "to": [
      "oc2consumer.company.net"
    ]
  },
  "body": {
    "openc2": {
      "request": {
        "action": "...",
        "target": "...",
        "args": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### E.1.2 Consumer HTTP Response with OpenC2 Response
Example message:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 19 Dec 2018 22:15:10 GMT
Content-type: application/openc2+json;version=1.0
X-Request-ID: d1ac0489-ed51-4345-9175-f3078f30afe5

{
  "headers": {
    "request_id": "d1ac0489-ed51-4345-9175-f3078f30afe5",
    "created": 1545257710000,
    "from": "oc2consumer.company.net",
    "to": [
      "oc2producer.company.net"
    ]
  },
  "body": {
    "openc2": {
      "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "status_text": "...",
        "results": "..."
      }
    }
  }
}
